```java
@Configuration
@EnableWebMvc 
public class WebConfig implements WebMvcConfigurer {   
	@Override   
	public void addInterceptors(InterceptorRegistry registry) {   
		registry.addInterceptor(new LocaleChangeInterceptor());   
		registry.addInterceptor(new ThemeChangeInterceptor()).addPathPatterns("/**").excludePathPatterns("/admin/**");
	}
}
```

```xml
<mvc:interceptors> 
	<bean class="org.springframework.web.servlet.i18n.LocaleChangeInterceptor"/> 
	<mvc:interceptor> 
		<mvc:mapping path="/**"/> 
		<mvc:exclude-mapping path="/admin/**"/> 
		<bean class="org.springframework.web.servlet.theme.ThemeChangeInterceptor"/> 
	</mvc:interceptor>
</mvc:interceptors>
```

Mapped interceptors are not ideally suited as a security layer due to the potential for a mismatch with annotated controller path matching, which can also match trailing slashes and path extensions transparently, along with other path matching options. Many of these options have been deprecated but the potential for a mismatch remains. Generally, we recommend using Spring Security which includes a dedicated MvcRequestMatcher to align with Spring MVC path matching and also has a security firewall that blocks many unwanted characters in URL paths.
